# SocialMonitor collector integration

Source: https://github.com/Shades-Media-Group/SocialMonitor

Pinned commit: `53302c9704a50dd3aea2518df08c35637d0e2b2b` (downloaded 2026-11-12).

The files in `vendor/collect/` and `vendor/types.ts` are copied from
`apps/app/src/core/` at that commit. The original MIT license is preserved in
`LICENSE`. No upstream dashboard, branding assets, AI provider, or SQLite store
is bundled. `vendor/db.ts` is a Speculara adapter exporting only `DATA_DIR`,
which is the browser helper's sole database-module dependency. The collector
source files are unchanged except `collect/instagram.ts`: Speculara captures the
normal profile feed and embedded Relay data before trying the legacy profile
endpoint, which can return HTTP 404. `instagram-data.mjs` maps current and legacy
timeline records into the upstream format. If comment retrieval fails, observed
post metrics are retained and further comment requests stop for that run.

`worker.mjs` adapts those collectors to a line-delimited JSON stdin/stdout protocol with progress events and graceful finish/cancel controls. Python
starts it without a shell. Browser cookies stay in `backend/.socialmonitor/`,
which is ignored by Git. The worker receives no Gemma or Supabase credentials.
Only the explicit login action opens a visible browser. It never enters a
password, posts, likes, follows, or sends messages.

Collection is limited to 20 recent posts and 8 comments per post in Speculara.
Instagram's upstream profile endpoint may return fewer posts and does not page
through the entire profile history. Comments need an Instagram session;
Facebook needs a session. TikTok uses the upstream logged-out collector.
Login walls/checkpoints are surfaced to the user. Platform changes may break
collection. No guarantee of complete historical data is made.

## Local setup

Use Node >=22.23.4 (Node 24 works). From the Speculara root:

```bash
npm.cmd run collector:setup
# Uses installed Google Chrome when available. Install Chromium as a fallback:
npm.cmd run collector:browser
npm.cmd run collector:test
```

Restart the Python backend and frontend as usual. Paste a supported profile
URL and click Analyze. To include Instagram comment text, choose Instagram and
click Sign in for comments; sign in manually, click Done signing in in Speculara, then Analyze.
The same control handles Facebook. A CLI equivalent is:

```bash
npm.cmd run collector:login -- instagram
```

On a server, both Python and Node plus a browser runtime are required. The
original Python-only Dockerfile does not provide the collector runtime. The
interactive sign-in endpoint is restricted to requests from this computer.
